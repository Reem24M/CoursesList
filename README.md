# Course Management System

This is a web-based Course Management System that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete courses. It also includes a login page for authentication. This system is built using React and Bootstrap.

## Features:

1. **Course List**: Displays a list of available courses.
2. **Course Details**: When you click on a course, you are redirected to a page that shows the course details.
3. **Add New Course**: Users can add new courses through a form.
4. **Edit Course**: Users can edit existing course details.
5. **Delete Course**: Users can delete a course, with a confirmation modal before deletion.
6. **Login Page**: Provides a login page for user authentication.

## Tech Stack:

* **Frontend**: React.js
* **CSS**: Bootstrap for styling
* **Routing**: React Router
* **State Management**: Local state for course management
* **Modals**: Bootstrap modal for delete confirmation

## Setup Instructions:

### Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

* **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
* **npm** (v6 or higher)

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/course-management.git
   cd course-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:

   After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Routes:

The application has the following routes:

* `/` - Home page showing the list of all courses.
* `/viewcourse/:id` - View the details of a specific course.
* `/editcourse/:id` - Edit an existing course.
* `/deletecourse/:id` - Delete a course with confirmation.

### How to Use:

1. **Home Page** (`/`):

   * Displays a list of all courses.
   * Each course is displayed as a card with its name, price, and description.
   * You can click on a course to view its detailed information.

2. **Course Details Page** (`/viewcourse/:id`):

   * When you click on a course from the home page, it will take you to the course details page.
   * The course details page displays the course name, description, price, and image.

3. **Add New Course** (`/addcourse`):

   * Navigate to the Add Course page by clicking the "Add New Course" button.
   * Fill in the course name, description, start date, end date, price, and an image URL.
   * Once the form is submitted, the course is added to the list and shown on the homepage.

4. **Edit Course** (`/editcourse/:id`):

   * From the course details page, you can click the "Edit" button to edit the course details.
   * You will be redirected to the Edit Course page, where you can modify the course's information and save the changes.

5. **Delete Course** (`/deletecourse/:id`):

   * From the course details page, you can click the "Delete" button to delete the course.
   * A confirmation modal will appear, asking if you are sure you want to delete the course. You can cancel or confirm the action.

6. **Login Page** (`/login`):

   * Provides a simple login form where users can input their credentials to log in (this can be extended with a backend for authentication).

### UI/UX Features:

* **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices. It uses Bootstrap's grid system to ensure that the course cards are displayed in a responsive manner.
* **Modals**: A confirmation modal appears when trying to delete a course, preventing accidental deletions.
* **Animated Links**: Links such as "Home", "Login", and others have animated hover effects to improve user experience.

### Example of Data (`data.json`):

```json
{
  "Courses": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Introduction to JavaScript",
      "description": "Learn the basics of JavaScript, the programming language of the web.",
      "startDate": "2025-05-01",
      "endDate": "2025-06-01",
      "price": 199,
      "imageUrl": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3861969/pexels-photo-3861969.jpeg"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "React for Beginners",
      "description": "Learn React.js and start building dynamic web applications.",
      "startDate": "2025-06-01",
      "endDate": "2025-07-01",
      "price": 249,
      "imageUrl": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3467526/pexels-photo-3467526.jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Future Enhancements:

* Add a backend API for storing and fetching courses data (instead of using `data.json`).
* Add form validation for the course addition and editing forms.
* Implement user authentication for the login page.
* Add sorting and filtering options for courses.
* Implement user roles (admin vs user) with different levels of access.
